    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Pizza Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a blender or food processor, purée tomatoes until mostly smooth.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in tomato paste and cook, stirring constantly, until darkened, 1 to 2 minutes. Add puréed tomatoes and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce is thickened and reduced by about one-third, 20 to 25 minutes. Taste and season with salt and granulated sugar for sweetness, if needed. Let cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Ahead:</strong> Pizza sauce can be made 5 days ahead. Let cool completely, then store in an airtight container and refrigerate, or freeze up to 1 month.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Garlic Bread Pizza</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°. On a large baking sheet, arrange bread halves garlic side up.</li>
        <li>Bake bread until warmed through and crisp on the sides and bottom, 9 to 11 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread each garlic bread half with 1/4 cup pizza sauce. Top with mozzarella, then pepperoni and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Heat broiler. Broil bread until cheese is bubbling and browned, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Top with red pepper flakes, if using. Slice and serve.</li>
    </ol>
